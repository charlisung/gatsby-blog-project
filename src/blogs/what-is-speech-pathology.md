What is speech pathology?

Speech Pathology is also referred to as Speech-Language Pathology. Often, the undergraduate and graduate major for this field is called Communication Disorders or Communication Sciences and Disorders. Generally, a Master’s Degree is necessary to become a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP), although it varies based on state laws as well as the needs of certain areas.

Who is a speech therapist?

An SLP, often colloquially known as a speech therapist, specializes in the assessment (also called evaluation or diagnosis) and treatment (also called therapy or intervention) of individuals with a wide range of disorders or delays. These include: speech, language and/or communication disorders, swallowing disorders, voice disorders, as well as disorders affecting cognition.

While an SLP is trained and educated in all of these fields, an SLP can generally narrow down which population they want to work with after graduating. An SLP who works at a school will have a completely different group of clients compared to an SLP who works at a skilled nursing facility or nursing home.

What is the role of a speech and language therapist?

The roles of an SLP vary greatly depending on the population with whom they choose to work. SLPs can choose to work with children from birth to age 3, preschool age, school age (K-12), with adults, and/or with the geriatric population. A person who works as an SLP in the outpatient department of a hospital or private practice could work with individuals from all of these populations in the same day!

To take my previous example, an SLP who works in a school will work with children who have varying delays, disorders, and/or disabilities. There is a common misconception that speech therapists are the people who only help kids “with lisps” or who “can’t say their R’s”. While we do work with children with articulation delays (also called speech sound disorders), SLPs also work with children with language, communication, cognition, swallowing, and voice.

When a speech-language pathologist refers to an individual’s speech, they are generally referring to articulation and phonology. Articulation refers to the clearness and crispness of an individual’s speech sounds. If a child says the letter /s/ with a slightly distorted quality (sometimes referred to as a lisp or slushy quality), this is very likely an articulation error. Phonology is similar but refers to when a child makes consistent patterns of errors such as using sounds like /w/ for the letters /r/ and /l/ in most cases (examples: “wed” for “red” and “yeh-whoa” for “yellow”).

Language refers to a lot of things including semantics (vocabulary), syntax (grammar), pragmatics (politeness, turntaking, personal space, etc.), and much more. Language is broken into receptive language and expressive language. In a very basic sense, receptive language refers to listening and reading, and expressive language refers to speaking and writing. Receptive language refers to how well you understand language, and expressive language refers how well you can produce it. Expressive language can refer to the vocab a kid knows, to her ability to string words together (grammar), or her ability to understand the pragmatics of the situation (getting the communication partner’s attention, staying on topic, giving the partner a turn, etc.) An individual might be more advanced in receptive language than expressive language, vice versa, or they might have a delay in both.

Communication and language are similar but have differences. You would probably agree that certain animals communicate but do not use language.

Where can you work as a speech pathologist?

An SLP has many choices of where to work, although the largest percentage of SLPs work in school environments. According to ASHA, about 53% of SLPs work in educational environments not including universities (which make up another 3%). These educational settings do not just include elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. They also include preschools and early intervention (services for children from birth to age three).

SLPs can also work in hospitals. If an SLP works in acute care (inpatient), they will often be working with people who had strokes, head injuries, or other medical incidents which affected their speech, language, swallowing, voice, etc. The patients in a hospital in these environments are often but not always adults of varying ages. You can also work in the rehab or outpatient environment in the hospital. I had the privilege of doing an internship in this environment. It was really exciting and never boring as my caseload included a ninety-year-old man and a three-year-old girl. Now that’s variety!

I have heard so many stories about people who went to school to become an SLP and had their heart set on working in schools only to realize how much they loved working in another environment, or vice versa. Graduate schools for speech-language pathology are great opportunities to get a myriad of experiences so you have a better idea of what your true passion is when you graduate.

How to become a speech pathologist
What qualifications do you need to be a speech and language therapist?

Generally, a Master’s Degree is necessary to become a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP), although it varies based on state laws as well as the needs of certain areas.

How long does it take to become a speech pathologist

If you major in Communication Sciences and Disorders (or Communication Disorders or whatever your school calls it!), then you will generally need to attend graduate school for two years before receiving your Master’s degree. Then, to become fully certified as a speech-language pathologist, you will need to complete a clinical fellowship year (also known as CF or CFY). A CF is generally 9-12 months (or until you complete a certain number of hours). During your CF, you will get paid fairly well and your salary can increase once you complete your fellowship and as you gain experience. During your CF, you will have a supervisor or mentor who may or may not work in the same location with you. It is important to have a supervisor who you feel confident going to and asking questions because you cannot be expected to be an expert after just graduating.
