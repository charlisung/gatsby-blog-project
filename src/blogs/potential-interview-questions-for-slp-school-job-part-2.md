What if a parent thinks a child needs more time per week with the SLP?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
This is a good chance to show the interviewer how you are able to see the positive in a lot of different situations. You could response to this question by saying this might be a case of a parent who has heard a lot about what their child can’t do and less about their child’s strengths and what they can do. You can tell the interviewer that you would emphasize the child is doing a lot of great things that you plan to continuing working on and improving even more in the time you have with him or her.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
What would you tell a parent who asked why their child can receive private speech services but not school speech services?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
In schools, SLPs must follow federal, state, and local regulations in regard to eligibility standards. Federal regulations were put in place by IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). Professionals at school including speech-language pathologists must determine: A) if a student has a disability, B) if it is affecting educational performance negatively, and C) if specialized services would benefit the student. One of the ways this is done is by standardized tests. Based on the student’s test scores, observation, school work analysis, etc., a child either does or does not qualify.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
However, private practices do not have to follow these same strict guidelines. Caregivers can choose to take their children to private practices, outpatient clinics, etc., and the SLPs in those settings may or may not find services to be necessary.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
What do you do in preparation for IEP meeting?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Chart progress of goals to be ready to show which goals have shown improvement and/or reached mastery
Prepare standardized and/or informal test scores and re-eval if necessary
Talk to other members of the team such as the classroom teacher to talk about how the child’s performing in class and whether there is carryover, improvement, or struggles
Reach out to the parent beforehand
What do they want to be in this IEP?
Or send home a speech-related form that can be sent to them in preparation for IEP and/or re-evaluation meetings
Allow the student to have input on what is important to them, what might be affecting or bothering them, and how they feel they have grown over the past year
Prepare potential new goals
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
What to do in IEP meetings?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Communicate the strengths of the student and not just the areas in which they must improve
Compare behavior and performance in different atmospheres
Ask the caregivers whether there are times when communication/behavior is better
One of my teachers compared this to a marriage counselor asking a couple, “Talk about when times were good.”
Learn from parent about what makes the child tic and with whom he/she is most comfortable
Learn what is important to parents, caregivers, etc. to influence goal-writing
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
What assessments do you have experience with?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
If you have a lot of different experiences with standardized assessments in the setting for which you are interviewing, then you might not even have to prep for this question. But in the case that you have not, it is not the end of the world. Go back and look at your notes for the courses you had regarding phonology, child language disorders, AAC, or whatever it may be. In my experience, a good answer to this question does not go much further than naming the tests and displaying you have a sufficient understanding of what they are for. For bonus points, be sure to mention more informal measures of assessment such as language samples, home and school observation, as well as rating scales given to parents, teachers, and other professionals.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
What experience do you have with AAC?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
When asked this question, it will certainly be important to name a few of the AAC devices you have worked with. For example, you could mention you have worked with individuals who used the iPad app Proloquo2go, visual scene displays, etc. However, remember a few things.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
First, AAC is not just referring to high-tech devices. Augmentative and alternative communication refers to all the methods we use to communicate and express our feelings, wants, needs, as well as to develop social relationships and to be polite. This includes gestures, facial expressions, low-tech pictures and symbols, writing, text messages, and more. AAC can be sign language, it can be PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) or visual schedules used by individuals on the autism spectrum, or it can be a whiteboard and a dry erase marker used by an individual with ALS. In fact, all of us use AAC every day of our lives. Therefore, you are selling yourself short if you just mention a few high-tech apps or stand-alone systems that you have experience with.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Second, AAC is not just about the system; it is about the individual using the system. In your response, talk about assessment and figuring out what system is right for the individual. This includes assessing natural speech skills, motor skills, literacy skills, as well as things like what the individual and their family determine to be important and/or feel as if they are currently limiting their communication and social participation.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Other components to consider are how multiple forms of AAC are almost always necessary. Once again, we all use multiple forms of AAC and multiple forms of communication. We think natural speech is the main form of communication but think about how crucial text messaging and emailing is in our lives. Similarly, giving individuals who would benefit from AAC just one system is never enough.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Third, AAC is not just about giving a child a system or two and sending them on their way. Continued intervention and caregiver training is even more crucial. Just as no one learns language in a day, no one can be expected to master a new mode of communication in a brief time. But if the system is not working, we do have to evaluate why and make changes which the AAC consumer and their family agree with and are on board with.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
So in short, discuss the systems who have experience with but also discuss the low-tech (and no tech) forms of AAC too. Talk about how assessment and follow-up are important.
