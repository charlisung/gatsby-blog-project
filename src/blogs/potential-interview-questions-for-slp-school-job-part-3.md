Describe three different ways in which you would support speech-based IEP goals for developmentally disabled students. How would you know if you were successful?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Speech-based IEP goals--such as those pertaining articulation and phonology--can be worked on in therapy with an SLP. However, the goals need to be supported in order to carry over to other environments besides the therapy room. With developmentally disabled students, special considerations must be made.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Consider the student’s diagnosis, abilities, strengths, and needs on an individual basis. For example, a student with cleft palate may have anatomical differences contributing to speech-based differences which cannot be solved without surgical interventions. A student with Down syndrome might have continue to have an articulation disorder despite therapy. Each student must be treated individually and realistically regarding what is functional for them and what makes best use of their current abilities.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Talk to the student’s teacher, parents, and peers about what the speech needs of that environment are. What is expected of typically developing children in a similar environment? In what areas is the student falling short of these expectations?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Involve teacher, parents, and peers in intervention when possible. Goals are more likely to be met when everyone is on the same page and the student gets as many chances to improve his or her speech-based goals as possible.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Data which records intelligibility, the number of communication breakdowns/repairs, and ability to meet the needs of the student’s environment (classroom, home, etc.) will allow me to know if intervention is successful. Some of this will be data recorded by me during therapy. However, I can also use teacher, parent, and peer reports to see if the goals are appropriate and being met.

You are the case manager of the Child Study Team for a highly under-performing 3rd grade student at your school. Her mother comes into your office unannounced and blames you for her daughter’s low level of performance, stating: “it is your job to provide her with the services she needs in order to perform at grade level, and since she isn’t at level, you are clearly not doing your job.” Write out your response to this parent.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Thanks for coming in today, Mrs. <Name>. I definitely understand that as a parent you are concerned about the progress of your daughter, and I appreciate that you came to talk with me today. Your daughter’s progress and development is very important to me, her classroom teacher, and the rest of the staff here. Would you be interested in scheduling a meeting with me and the other members of your daughter’s Child Study Team? We can discuss our IEP goals for her and the improvements we have seen. We can also talk about the concerns you have about why she is not performing at grade level so that we can discuss if any improvements can be made to our plan for her. I want to thank you again for being willing to come to me about your concerns regarding your daughter. It is clear you want what is best for your daughter and, rest assured, we will to continue to work with her and think about what we can do as a team to help her too. I look forward to talking to you again soon (at the meeting).

Describe the skills or attributes you believe are necessary to be an outstanding teacher.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
I believe these skills include patience, passion, persistence, and versatility. We must have patience because students are young, full of energy, and, most importantly, unique. All children are different and learn in different ways, and teachers sometimes need to reflect on what they consider misbehavior. As a brief example, I have witnessed students being repeatedly told to sit in their chair when they are a little squirmy. However, what is more of a distraction: the multiple commands from the teacher or the fidgety student? A lot of times, the teacher is the only person who notices and the student is doing it because they are excited about the lesson. We do not want to extinguish that excitement. Passion is an important characteristic because teachers who love their job will be more dedicated to doing absolutely anything they can for their students. This leads into persistence. Not every lesson will work, even the ones you prepare a whole night for. We as teachers have to dust ourselves off and keep working hard; even Michael Jordan missed more than half the shots he took. That takes me to the last skill or attribute that I find most important: versatility. Teachers must always be creative and come up with new ideas about what will motivate and educate the students so they can reach curricular goals and grow as individuals.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
How would you address a wide range of skills and abilities in your classroom?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
While speech-language pathologists often see students one-on-one or in small groups, being able to address this is still a crucial skill for our job. If I have a group session, children might have various speech or language goals such as articulation, stuttering, and receptive language deficit, just to name a few. I would emphasize to them that we all have certain skills we are strong at and certain skills we are working on, and we are going to work together on them. This will give the students confidence regarding their strengths and yet a sense of comfort being with other kids who have something they are working on too. Individually, I might remind the students what they are working on. For example, a student who stutters might be working on specific strategies and this group activity could be a great naturalistic chance at practicing them. Then, while doing the activity, I would have individualized questions or directions for the students based on their speech goals while staying within the framework of the overall activity.
