From what I have heard and gathered, a good way to approach interview questions for speech-language pathologist jobs is to display positivity and a willingness to keep learning. For example, if you are asked about a challenging parent, why not explain how you would use it as a chance to sing the praises of her child? Perhaps that parent has heard time and time again about what her child cannot do, instead of what the child excels at. That is just one example, but this positivity driven strategy can be used in all types of interview questions (and when you finally get the job too!)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Can you discuss a time you worked with a challenging client and how you handled the situation? / Can you describe an ideal therapy session for you?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
If you are asked the section question above, I believe this is a great opportunity to turn the situation on its head by showing that working with challenging students can actually be “ideal”. Are certain clients more complex than others? Of course. But we did not get into this field because we wanted to sit around all day, right? Those with the most complex needs are those who need our help most.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
When asked this question, you can start off with a brief description of the child with particularly complex communication needs. Then discuss how you thought about the situation long and hard, how you consulted resources or advisors, and how you came up with a creative and effective solution.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
I like to tell the story of a particular client on the autism spectrum who had some challenging behaviors. I talk about how I worked as a team with other professionals, how we tried to determine why behaviors were occurring, and lastly what his strengths and interests were. From there, we were able to make a lesson that was not only interesting to the boy but also playing up to his strengths. This particular child loved the Cars movies by Disney Pixar. He has displayed a lot of echolalia in his speech. I created picture books emphasizing simple grammar structures and then repeated these grammatical structures in other environments with the child. It was really rewarding and effective, and the child’s language and behavior improved as well.

What is your greatest weakness as a clinician?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
The above exchange comes from the TV show The Office. For the few of you who do not know, Michael is a buffoon and an egotist. Don’t be like Michael! Instead of just blatantly rattling off a bunch of strengths as your weakness like in this exchange, how do we answer this age old interview question? Well, I guess Michael was not all wrong.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
While we do not want to give the cringeworthy “I care too much” answer, I think it we should somehow sandwich a positive into our answer or at least show how we are versatile, flexible, and open to always learning and improving.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
For me, a real weakness I have is having trouble being assertive with other professionals. If I were to tell this to interviewers, I would first phrase the weakness in the past tense to distance myself from it. I might say something like this: In the past, I struggled with being assertive towards other professionals. However, as time passed and my clinical experiences and expertise grew, I made a concerted effort to be assertive when I think it is in the best interests of the student. I have gotten very positive feedback from supervisors that I am able to be emphatic while not being pushy or aggressive.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Come up with an actual weakness of yourself, frame it in the past tense, talk about how you actively worked on your weakness, and feel free to throw in that you know you are not perfect but will always keep striving to improve.

What is the difference between a disorder and a delay?
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
Most children learn to speak and use language in similar ways. For example, when a young child speakers, she might say “wed” instead of “red”. This is so common that we are not even concerned about it for a good number of years. When a child experiences a delay, however, she is making these types of errors for longer than expected. Similarly, when referring to a language delay, if a child says “I goed to school” this might be a part of the language learning process, but could represent a delay if it continues past when it would be expected to be extinguished. Of course, there is a range to these expectations; kids don’t just magically start producing perfect r’s on their, say, sixth birthday! Also, every child is different. There are even some research-proven differences between gender as girls tend to develop speech and language skills a little quicker than boys but it generally all evens out.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
There is also a third distinction that should be considered in certain cases: a language difference. A language difference refers to when a child’s second language might be behind that of her first language which is developing as expected. In this case, the “errors” that the child is making are generally nothing to be alarmed by as they are simply part of the second language learning process and are often influenced by the child’s first language.
